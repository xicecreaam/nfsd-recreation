# Simple Career Any% guide

The perfect route to start your speedrunning journey.

## Lapglitch

Start the run by lapglitching circuits **C14**, **C1**, **C2** & **C3**. You can press LB/L1 to lapglitch **C14** faster, depending if you're using an XInput or a DSX controller. Then, RB/R1 or LB/L1 twice to lapglitch C1, C2 & C3.

## Prologue

Watch the absolute cutscene banger and when you gain control of the BMW, use full NOS and go as fast as possible until Mia calls you regarding a mysterious oil leak on your ride.

Complete Ronnie and Bull sprints. Then, you will face Roger (aka Rog) with 2 unique opponents. This race is fully scripted and the opponents, besides their names, will always have the same cars. Usually, after this race you have a cutscene involving Razor and you but you can **skip this cutscene very easily**. The moment you cross the finish line, **restart the race** then open the menu, quit back to main menu and go into career again. This glitch will skip the cutscene and will send you directly to Razor sprint.

During Razor sprint, at around 73% of the track, Mia calls you to warn you about an oil leak you left at the starting line. Your BMW has been sabotaged and you will lose the race, resulting in the loss of your car. Then, after the cutscene you will be asked to choose a new car. Choose the Golf (4th car). You will then spawn outside and Mia will ask you to go to your *Safe house*.

#### Remarks

Rog circuit race is "*unlapglitchable*" since it's not available in Quick Race. Plus, it has a unique hex address.

After buying the Golf, while driving to the *Safe house*, turn right where the path splits despite the arrow telling you to go left.

## Sonny

Do *Race 1* from the *Safe house*. After finishing the race, turn around and go to the performance shop. Install any *spoiler* you want and *Race Engine*.  
Do *Race 2*. Once at the stadium, at around 51% of the race, press start and tune *Aerodynamics* to `+5`. After the race, start a chase manually from *Bounty 2*.

Do the required speedtrap *Camera 1* manually from the *Milestone menu*. **(130 km/h | 80 mph)**  
Do *Race 3* then challenge Sonny. Complete both *Boss races*.  
<font color="red">**Don't boss skip !**</font> Just spam your Confirm button (A or X). You can use the mouse too. Choose *2 random markers* and confirm to move on to the next boss.

## Taz

At this point, there are 2 possible scenarios here :

* **Scenario 1 — You got the cash marker (with or without Sonny's pinkslip / car).**

    Upgrade *Race Transmission*, *Pro Suspension* and *Pro NOS*.  
    Do *Camera 1*. **(150 km/h | 93 mph)**  

* **Scenario 2 — You got Sonny's pinkslip / car only.**

    Go back to the *Safe house* and sell Sonny's car.  
    Lapglitch circuits **C4** & **C5**.  
    Quit to free roam, go to the performance shop to your right and upgrade *Race Transmission*, *Pro Suspension* and *Pro NOS*.

#### The following route is the same for each scenario.

Do *Camera 1*. **(150 km/h | 93 mph)**  
Start *Race 4*. During this race, after the 2 small S corners, tune *Handling* to `-1`, *Ride Height* to `+5` and *NOS* to `+2`.  
Do *Race 3* from the *Safe house*. If you trigger the cops in the race, finish the race without losing them. Then, continue forwards to the stadium and kill everybody chasing you with the stadium pursuit breaker. Escape on the **same hiding spot** as on Sonny.  
If you don't get cops during *Race 3*, do a manual chase from *Bounty 2* instead and do the following chase. You would also do *Camera 2* **(145 km/h | 90 mph)** during this chase.

Like Ming, the bounty requirement for this chase is not an exact amount. It highly depends on how much bounty you got after Ming chase knowing that you need to accumulate 2300k bounty to challenge him. With this **2300k base**, you will need **912k bounty** during JV chase, as fast as possible. However, this amount can be drastically reduced if the bounty grinding during Ming chase was good. To sum up, let's draw up a table :

| Bounty at the end <br /> of Ming chapter | Bounty requirement <br /> for JV chase |
|:--------------------------------------:|:------------------------------------:|
| 2300k                                  | 912k                                 |
| 2400k                                  | 812k                                 |
| 2500k                                  | 712k                                 |
| 2800k                                  | 412k                                 |

After the chase, do a *QE* from *Bounty 1*.  
Lapglitch circuit **C18** and knockout track **KO14**.  
In case of you are short on bounty, you can do *Camera 1* and/or *Camera 2*.  
Do *Race 2*, *Race 3*, *Race 5*, *Race 6*, *Race 7*, *Race 8* and *Race 9*.  
Challenge JV and complete the 3 *Boss races*.  
**Boss skip !** Choose the *Performance marker*, *1 random marker* and confirm to move on to the next boss.

## Bull

Upgrade *Ultimate Engine* and *Junkman Engine*.  
Do *Camera 1* from the *Milestone menu*. After getting it, immediately take the right way leading to the intersection above, turn right and continue towards *Camera 3*.

Go back to the *Safe house* and lapglitch circuit **C23**.  
Do *Race 1*. After the finishline, continue forwards and go hit *Camera 2*. It is located a bit after the end of the tunnel.  
Do *Race 2*, *Race 6* and *Race 8*. You should get an SMS from Razor putting you immediately on **:fire: 5**.  
Do a manual chase from *Bounty 2*. Don't do any cooldown trick here, the spawn speed of condition 5 cops is already fast enough. Earn 200k cost to state and avoid 8 spikes to complete 2 milestones. It is possible that you get 12 roadblocks before getting 8 spikes, depending on your RNG luck. If so, don't bother avoiding 8 spikes.  
The bounty requirement here is 2700k minimum. The more bounty you have at this point will be useful for the next chapter.  
Do *Race 9*, *Race 10*, *Race 11* and *Race 12*.  
Challenge Bull and complete the 3 *Boss races*.  
<font color="red">**Don't boss skip !**</font> Choose *2 random markers* and confirm to move on to the next boss.

## Razor

Don't upgrade here since there is nothing to upgrade left.  
Do *Camera 3* from the *Milestone menu*. This camera can be a bit tricky for a new player and might require practice, especially if there is traffic. After getting it, turn left and hit *Camera 1*.  
Do *Race 10* and after the finishline, turn immediately on the left way to hit Ronnie *Camera 1*.  
Do *Race 11* and after the finishline, turn immediately left and go hit *Camera 2*.  
Do *Race 1* and *Race 2*. Then go back to the *Safe house* and start *Race 3*. This race has a particular maxmimum cop probability and should always spawn a cop during it. Nonetheless, you can also finish the race without seeing any cop. If so, do a manual chase from *Bounty 2*. Earn 850k bounty to complete 1 milestone.  
The bounty requirement depends on how much you did get during Bull chase. Like JV chapter, let's take the prerequisite bounty of Bull which is 7550k and draw up a table.

| Bounty at the end <br /> of Bull chapter | Bounty requirement <br /> for Razor chase |
|:--------------------------------------:|:---------------------------------------:|
| 7550k                                  | 1368k                                   |
| 7700k                                  | 1218k                                   |
| 7900k                                  | 1018k                                   |
| 8000k                                  | 918k                                    |

Do *Race 4, *Race 5*, *Race 8* and *Race 9*.   
Challenge Razor and complete the 5 *Boss races*.  
> On *Race 3*, at 60% of the track, there is a hole at the end of the barrier that allows you to sneak through and going **O**ut **O**f **B**ounds (as known as **OOB**). This way you can skip around 1.5km of the track (which represents 24% of the track).

## Final pursuit

Initially, you had to play with cops for 5 minutes before getting called by Mia telling you that you have to go to the old bridge to escape the cops. But you can break this 5 minutes call by performing **another OOB** in the docks. We call it the "Garage clip".  
This OOB occurs in two steps :
* the "Garage clip",
* the "Rock jump", this step is a jump where you tilt your car with a certain angle to be able to drive towards the old bridge, avoiding the construction site blocking the original entrance.

Ultimately, you can complete this event in under 2:30 very easily and this is how to do it properly but a video is worth a thousand words...

## Congratulations ! You just finished your first ever run.
