# Setting up for speedruns

All the information needed to set up the PC version of Most Wanted for speedruns.

## Game version

The lap glitch used in Any% requires a **European 1.2 version** of the game, which was never sold digitally. Your best bet is finding a used physical copy. Alternatively, you can try [the downpatcher](https://www.speedrun.com/nfsmw05/resources/oc3zl), but it does not work for everyone.

Another option is choosing a category which does not require lap glitch. These are : `No Major Glitches, Challenge Series, No Lap Glitch`.

**Recommended language for the game is English.** Based on limited testing, it has the fastest voice lines for dispatch which affects how quickly cops can start spawning during races. Avoid languages without a dub, otherwise you are going to receive additional message popups during prologue and the final chase.

If you have Underground 1 installed, you need to temporarily rename its executable for the installer to work.

### Console ?

The boss skip is a PC exclusive glitch which allows us to skip half of the bosses in career, making the PC version the fastest. Additionally, console versions have inconsistent framerates, more loading screens, longer load times and lower accessibility. The slowest version is the Xbox 360 one, because you don't have access to an Underground 2 savefile. Recommended categories for console players : All Bosses (1.2 required), No Major Glitches, Challenge Series (Challenge #68 and/or 100%)

## Validating your install

Make sure the intro videos and cutscenes play correctly. Invalid installations with missing or broken videos are not allowed. For example, when you launch the game, after the very short loading screen, if you are automatically sent to the splashscreen (the `Press to Start to continue` screen), your installation is invalid.

Make sure that the game music, sound effects, assets all play and appear correctly. Modified installations are not allowed. For more information, read [the Category rules from speedrun.com](https://www.speedrun.com/nfsmw05?h=Career_Any-Glitches&rules=category&x=w20n48dn-yn2dod85.4qy7yo3q).
