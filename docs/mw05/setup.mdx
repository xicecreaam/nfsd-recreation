# Setting up for speedruns

All the information needed to set up the PC version of Most Wanted for speedruns.

## Game version

The lap glitch used in Any% requires a European 1.2 version of the game, which was never sold digitally. Your best bet is finding a used physical copy. Alternatively, you can try the downpatcher, but it does not work for everyone.

Another option is choosing a category which does not require lap glitch. These are: No Major Glitches, Challenge Series, No Lap Glitch.

Recommended language for the game is English. Based on limited testing, it has the fastest voice lines for dispatch which affects how quickly cops can start spawning during races. Avoid languages without a dub, otherwise you are going to receive additional message popups during prologue and the final chase.
