# General Information

All the information needed to get the basics of the game.

## Controller or keyboard ?

**Both input devices** (XInput & DualSense) are OK to use to play the game. However, playing **with a controller** will be better in any way since you can smooth steer. Keyboard can be also used but **only for Individual Levels (ILs)**. You will lose time using a keyboard compared to a controller and this whole guide, **it is considered that you are using a controller to run**. To date, all of the any% runs have been done with a controller device.

### Menuing

The menuing in this game is **not instant**. Unlike his predecessor Underground 2, you must have a certain rythm with it. This implies being frame-perfect while menuing. And no... macros won't help you in any way since the game "eats" inputs very weirdly : you can spam **as fast ast you want**, game will **scam** you. However, if you want to navigate through menus very fast, **buffering** left/right arrows can be very useful. *Navigate with the scroll wheel works in the game but it isn't used since you have to let go of your controller then get it back which can result in a time loss.*

## Driving techniques

Don’t go **full throttle instantly** after any race starts. You would **hold** the throttle at perfect launch level for around 0.3 - 0.4 second after the race starts and then go full throttle + use NOS.

Try to smooth steer as much as you can without making too many rapid analog stick movements unless you have to take very sharp corners.

Try to use your NOS for a bigger duration of time on longer straights. The goal here is **to not spam it randomly**. It is also pointless to use it while mid-air where you don't gain speed this way.

Speedbreaker allows the player to enter a temporary state of slow motion. But it is not the only ability the feature gives. It also doubles approximatively your car mass and, so, can be useful to :

* use on jumps,
* take some sharp corners,
* when colliding with cops,
* reduce your speed loss if you hit traffic / lamp posts / signs / etc.

## Police & pursuits mechanics

When you kill cops, you can benefit of something called `bounty combo`. See it like a multiplier set to your bounty grind : you kill one cop and you will have its `cop bounty reward x 1`. You kill another cop, `cop bounty reward x 2`. You kill a third cop, `cop bounty reward x 3`. This combo stays for exactly 10 seconds between each kill. If you don't kill any cop within this window, the combo will drop to the `x 1` multiplier.
