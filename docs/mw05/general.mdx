# General Information

All the information needed to get the basics of the game.

## Controller or keyboard ?

**Both input devices** (XInput & DualSense) are OK to use to play the game. However, playing **with a controller** will be better in any way since you can smooth steer. Keyboard can be also used but **only for Individual Levels (ILs)**. You will lose time using a keyboard compared to a controller and this whole guide, **it is considered that you are using a controller to run**. To date, all of the any% runs have been done with a controller device.

### Menuing

The menuing in this game is **not instant**. Unlike his predecessor Underground 2, you must have a certain rythm with it. This implies being frame-perfect while menuing. And no... macros won't help you in any way since the game "eats" inputs very weirdly : you can spam **as fast ast you want**, game will **scam** you. However, if you want to navigate through menus very fast, **buffering** left/right arrows can be very useful. *Navigate with the scroll wheel works in the game but it isn't used since you have to let go of your controller then get it back which can result in a time loss.*

## Driving techniques

Don’t go **full throttle instantly** after any race starts. You would **hold** the throttle at perfect launch level for around 0.3 - 0.4 second after the race starts and then go full throttle + use NOS.

Try to smooth steer as much as you can without making too many rapid analog stick movements unless you have to take very sharp corners.

Try to use your NOS for a bigger duration of time on longer straights. The goal here is **to not spam it randomly**. It is also pointless to use it while mid-air where you don't gain speed this way.

Speedbreaker allows the player to enter a temporary state of slow motion. But it is not the only ability the feature gives. It also doubles approximatively your car mass and, so, can be useful to :

* use on jumps,
* take some sharp corners,
* when colliding with cops,
* reduce your speed loss if you hit traffic / lamp posts / signs / etc.

## Police & pursuits mechanics

The maximum number of cops that can chase you at a given time is different based on the condition you are in :

* Condition 1 = **4 cops**
* Condition 2 = **5 cops**
* Condition 3 = **6 cops**
* Condition 4 = **7 cops**
* Condition 5 = **8 cops**

You start getting light SUVs at condition 3 and heavy SUVs at condition 4 and 5. They spawn in two different ways : **when a roadblock spawn** or **when a rhino wave spawn**.

You start getting a helicopter and spike spawns at condition 4. You can kill the helicopter if it flies over a triggered pursuit breaker *(it can also trigger the tire and donut pursuit breakers by itself and kill itself)*. To know if you killed the helicopter, your bounty should end on a number that’s not 0 e.g. `18` or `54`. For some reasons, the bounty reward of the helicopter is missing and when you kill it, you are granted a random small amount of bounty. Escaping while being chased by the helicopter can be hard sometimes. Note that he won't never bust you but he will idle above you and to escape it (+ the cops) you need to find a hiding spot where there is a "roof". There are few blindspots around the map but there is one that is very effective. You can [follow this tutorial](https://youtu.be/jynWhHpASlU?t=9111) to see how to do it.

When you kill cops, you can benefit of something called `bounty combo`. See it like a multiplier set to your bounty grind : you kill one cop and you will have its `cop bounty reward x 1`. You kill another cop, `cop bounty reward x 2`. You kill a third cop, `cop bounty reward x 3`. This combo stays for exactly 10 seconds between each kill. If you don't kill any cop within this window, the combo will drop to the `x 1` multiplier.

Always try to get a full combo kill on cops. Be **patient**, wait for all of your cops to be around you and then kill them on a pursuit breaker to maximize your bounty. The key is to not just randomly go around at max speed.

While being chase, you can know when a cop spawn thanks to UI : if the Cost to State popup rises without you hitting any object on the road, it is the indicator a new cop has spawned.

The best way to kill cops in a block is to approach it in a **diagonal pattern** by hitting them with a specific angle. Light SUVs collisions are somehow bugged. When you hit it with the right angle, it can spin out like a fidget spinner. Heavy SUVs collisions are fine though. **Using a traffic car** can be really useful for spinning any cop car in general.

Below are some examples of how to properly flip the cops in different roadblocks.

## Map-related warnings & known game bugs

**Avoid the highways and Rosewood’s stadium at all costs on conditions 4 and 5**. The game has a memory leak when it tries to spawn a block and the game may crash. *It can also crash on condition 3 as well but it’s a small chance*.

[This hiding spot](https://imgur.com/a/kA4vorU) is generally one of the safest spots to escape cops. Sometimes you may experience a bug where the helicopter will keep seeing you no matter what and you have to **go outside and come back again** to fully fix it.

Escaping in the safe house skips having to wait for the cooldown. Doing this strat may cause the **safe house escape glitch** where you don’t go inside it but get spawned outside and immediately start a new chase.
