# Simple Career Any% guide

The perfect route to start your speedrunning journey.

## <font color="#d94c4c">Prerequisite before starting</font>

Make sure to have the Level of Details **one bar below the max**. You will hit less stuff on the road.

***

## Lapglitch

Start the run by lapglitching circuits **1**, **2**, **3** and lap knockout **1**.

## Prologue

Watch the absolute cutscene banger and when you gain control of the BMW, use full NOS and go as fast as possible until Mia calls you regarding a mysterious oil leak on your ride.  
Complete Ronnie and Bull sprints. Then, you will face Roger (as known as Rog) with 2 unique opponents. This race is fully scripted and the opponents, besides their names, will always have the same cars. Finish it.  
You will now face Razor during a sprint. At around 73% of the track, Mia calls you to warn you about an oil leak you left at the starting line. Your BMW has been sabotaged and you will lose the race, resulting in the loss of your car. Then, after the cutscene you will be asked to choose a new car. Choose the Golf (4th car). You will then spawn outside and Mia will ask you to go to your *Safe house*.

#### Remarks

* Rog circuit race is "*unlapglitchable*" since it's not available in Quick Race.

* After buying the Golf, while driving to the *Safe house*, [turn right where the path splits](https://ibb.co/Mys8yKsZ) despite the arrow telling you to go left.

## Sonny

Do *Race 1* from the *Safe house*. After finishing the race, turn around and go to the performance shop. Install any *spoiler* you want and *Race Engine*.  
Do *Race 2*. Once at the stadium, at around 48% of the race, press start and tune *Aerodynamics* to `+5`.  
Start a manual chase from *Bounty 2* and do the following chase.

* Gather 3 cops and go to the stadium.
* Don't kill them already, you need to wait at least **1:53 before killing your cops wave**. Once at 1:53, kill them and escape on [this escape spot](https://ibb.co/006XPNR).
* You can check an example of a chase below ↓.

## Taz

At this point, there are 2 possible scenarios here :

* **Scenario 1 — You got a cash marker.**

    Upgrade *Race Transmission*, *Pro Suspension* and *Pro NOS*.  
    Do *Camera 1* **(150 km/h | 93 mph)**.  

* **Scenario 2 — You got Sonny's car <ins>only</ins>.**

    Go back to the *Safe house* and sell Sonny's car.  
    Quit to free roam, go to the performance shop to your right and upgrade *Race Transmission*, *Pro Suspension* and *Pro NOS*.  
    Do *Camera 1* **(150 km/h | 93 mph)**.

#### The following route is the same for each scenario.
  
Tune *Handling* to `-1`, *Ride Height* to `+5` and *NOS* to `+2`.  
Do *Camera 2* **(145 km/h | 90 mph)**.  
Go back to the *Safe house* and start *Race 3*. If you trigger the cops in the race, finish the race without losing them.

* Continue forwards to the stadium and kill everybody chasing you with the stadium pursuit breaker. Escape on the **same hiding spot** as on Sonny.

If you don't get cops during *Race 3*, start a manual chase from *Bounty 2* instead and do the following chase.

## Final pursuit

Initially, you had to play with cops for 5 minutes before getting called by Mia telling you that you have to go to the old bridge to escape the cops. But you can break this 5 minutes call by performing **another OOB** in the docks. We call it the "Garage clip".  
This OOB occurs in two steps :

* the "Garage clip",
* the "Rock jump", this step is a jump where you tilt your car with a certain angle to be able to drive towards the old bridge, avoiding the construction site blocking the original entrance.

Ultimately, you can complete this event in under 2:30 very easily.

Once you gain control of the BMW, turn around, turn left before the Amusment Park towards the lighthouse and head to the docks. This is where you find the garage door. This is how to do it properly but a video is worth a thousand words...
