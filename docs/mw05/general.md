# General Information

All the information needed to get the basics of the game.  
Reading this document is mandatory for you. For each route described in this guide, it is assumed that the elements described here have been taken into account.

## Controller or keyboard ?

**Both input devices** (XInput & DualSense) are OK to use to play the game. However, playing **with a controller** will be better in any way since you can smooth steer. Keyboard can be also used but **only for Individual Levels (ILs)**. You will lose time using a keyboard compared to a controller and this whole guide, **it is considered that you are using a controller to run**. To date, all of the any% runs have been done with a controller device.

## Menuing

The menuing in this game is **not instant**. Unlike his predecessor Underground 2, you must have a certain rythm with it. This implies being frame-perfect while menuing. And no... macros won't help you in any way since the game "eats" inputs very weirdly : you can spam **as fast ast you want**, game will **scam** you. However, if you want to navigate through menus very fast, **buffering** left/right arrows can be very useful. *Navigate with the scroll wheel works in the game but it isn't used since you have to let go of your controller then get it back which can result in a time loss.*

> **:bangbang: Instead of being frame-perfect in the menuing, you can put the in-game mouse cursor right on the `Yes` button in any `Are you sure you want to [...] ?` prompt.** Safe House prompts and free roam prompts are not at the same height on the screen, so be sure to put your cursor **a bit under the `Yes` word of the Safe House prompts**.

## Events order

In order to get along on the rest of the guide, here is an example of how events will be code-named.

## Driving techniques

During races, especially the starting cooldown, you want to do a perfect start to get an additional speed bonus. To do this easily, you can **full throttle during the 2 first seconds** of the cooldown then **release it** to time the perfect start. Note that those 2 seconds will be different if you are driving a different car (each car has is own max RPM). Alternatively, if you feel it, **hold** the throttle at perfect launch level during the cooldown.

Try to smooth steer as much as you can without making too many rapid analog stick movements unless you have to take very sharp corners.

Try to use your NOS for a bigger duration of time on longer straights. The goal here is **to not spam it randomly**. It is also pointless to use it while mid-air where you don't gain speed this way.

Speedbreaker allows the player to enter a temporary state of slow motion. But it is not the only ability the feature gives. It also doubles approximatively your car mass and, so, can be useful to :

* use on jumps,
* take some sharp corners,
* when colliding with cops,
* reduce your speed loss if you hit traffic / lamp posts / signs / etc.

## Police stuff & pursuits mechanics

Most Wanted introduces the **Heat Level** system. It is tied to your car and is highlighted by its wanted status by the police and determined by the most recent successful pursuit. There are 5 levels of heat available going from **:fire: 1** to **:fire: 5** (except **:fire: 6** and **:fire: 7** which are reserved for unique events). Each heat comes with special units, unique tactics and other things that aren't told to the player directly.

| Condition | Max Engaged Units | Vehicles                                               | Backup Timer | Cooldown Timer | Tactics                                                 |
| :-------: | :---------------: | :----------------------------------------------------: | :----------: | :------------: | :-----------------------------------------------------: |
| 1         | 5                 | Civic Cruiser                                          | 180 seconds  | 20 seconds     | Follow, Rolling Roadblock                               |
| 2         | 10                | Civic Undercover Cruiser                               | 120 seconds  | 45 seconds     | Box, Rolling Roadblock, All Roadblock Types             |
| 3         | 15                | State Cruiser, Light SUV                               | 120 seconds  | 75 seconds     | Box, Herd, P.I.T., All Roadblock Types, Head-on SUV Ram |
| 4         | 20                | Undercover State Cruiser, Heavy SUV, Police Helicopter | 120 seconds  | 90 seconds     | All Ground Tactics, Spike Strips, Air Support           |
| 5         | 25                | Federal Cruiser, Heavy SUV, Police Helicopter, Cross   | 90 seconds   | 120 seconds    | All Tactics                                             |

##### Source : game files

The maximum number of cops that can chase you at a given time is different based on the condition you are in :

* Condition 1 = **4 cops**
* Condition 2 = **5 cops**
* Condition 3 = **7 cops**
* Condition 4 = **8 cops**
* Condition 5 = **10 cops**

When you kill cops and there are only two cops left chasing you, you will trigger a **backup**. The backup timer depends on which heat you are **(cf. the table above)**.

You start getting light SUVs at condition 3 and heavy SUVs at condition 4 and 5. They spawn in two different ways : **when a roadblock spawn** or **when a rhino wave spawn**.

You start getting a helicopter and spike spawns at condition 4. You can kill the helicopter if it flies over a triggered pursuit breaker *(it can also trigger the tire and donut pursuit breakers by itself and kill itself)*. To know if you killed the helicopter, your bounty should end on a number that’s not 0 e.g. `18` or `54`. For some reasons, the bounty reward of the helicopter is missing and when you kill it, you are granted a random small amount of bounty. Escaping while being chased by the helicopter can be hard sometimes. Note that he won't never bust you but he will idle above you and to escape it (+ the cops) you need to find a hiding spot where there is a "roof". There are few blindspots around the map but there is one that is very effective. You can [follow this tutorial](https://youtu.be/jynWhHpASlU?t=9111) to see how to do it.

When you kill cops, you can benefit of something called `bounty combo`. See it like a multiplier set to your bounty grind : you kill one cop and you will have its `cop bounty reward x 1`. You kill another cop, `cop bounty reward x 2`. You kill a third cop, `cop bounty reward x 3`. This combo stays for exactly 10 seconds between each kill. If you don't kill any cop within this window, the combo will drop to the `x 1` multiplier.

Always try to get a full combo kill on cops. Be **patient**, wait for all of your cops to be around you and then kill them on a pursuit breaker to maximize your bounty. The key is to not just randomly go around at max speed.

While being chased, you can know when a cop spawn thanks to UI : if the Cost to State popup rises without you hitting any object on the road, it is the indicator a new cop has spawned.

Also while being chased, you will commit **infractions**. There are 8 infractions in total, respectively :

|        Infraction        |                            Action                            |
|:------------------------:|:------------------------------------------------------------:|
|    Damage to Property    |   Hit or destroy any public property (sign, lamp post, ...)  |
|    Driving Off Roadway   | Drive outside a driving surface (grass, dirt, sidewalk, ...) |
|    Excessive Speeding    |           Drive above a speed of 290 km/h (180 mph)          |
|         Hit & Run        |                     Hit a traffic vehicle                    |
| Ramming a Police Vehicle |                     Hit a police vehicle                     |
|     Reckless Driving     |           Drive above a speed of 322 km/h (200 mph)          |
|     Resisting Arrest     |          Evade a police pursuit (enter in cooldown)          |
|         Speeding         |           Drive above a speed of 241 km/h (150 mph)          |

#### Every infraction are triggered when a cop is **close enough to you**. Otherwise nothing will happen.

The best way to kill cops in a block is to approach it in a **diagonal pattern** by hitting them with a specific angle. Light SUVs collisions are somehow bugged. When you hit it with the right angle, it can spin out like a fidget spinner. Heavy SUVs collisions are fine though. **Using a traffic car** can be really useful for spinning any cop car in general.

Below are some examples of how to properly flip the cops in different roadblocks.

## Map-related warnings & known game bugs

**Avoid the highways and Rosewood’s stadium at all costs on conditions 4 and 5**. The game has a memory leak when it tries to spawn a block and the game may crash. *It can also crash on condition 3 as well but it’s a small chance*.

[This hiding spot](https://ibb.co/1Y67vGV8) is generally one of the safest spots to escape cops. Sometimes you may experience a bug where the helicopter will keep seeing you no matter what and you have to **go outside and come back again** to fully fix it.

Escaping in the safe house skips having to wait for the cooldown. Doing this strat may cause the **safe house escape glitch** where you don’t go inside it but get spawned outside and immediately start a new chase.

## Lap glitch (also known as lapglitch)

This glitch allows you to **reduce any lapped event from the career to 1 lap + the traffic density to minimum** by searching the race you want to glitch in the quick race menu *(number of opponents, difficulty and catch-up aren't affected)*.

In other words, when you change the number of laps and the traffic density of a race in the quick race menu, the applied settings somehow carry over to the career. This glitch works on every Circuit / Lap knockout tracks.

### How does it work ?

1. Go to Quick Race.
2. Search for a race you want to glitch.
3. Select it and change the settings to what you want.
4. Confirm the settings, so then you are on the car selection screen.
5. Go back to your career, start your new glitched-race.

<details className="alert alert--info details">

  <summary>Lap knockout lap glitch example</summary>
  <img src="/nfsd-recreation/img/mw-lapglitch-lapknockout.gif" alt="Gif showing how to perform the lap glitch on a lap knockout track" />
</details>

To know if the glitch works : the UI should show the "Lap 1/1" sign on the top right corner of the race UI. Also, it may still show "Lap 1/2" or "Lap 1/3" if you've started the race from free roam but the glitch will still work.

#### Remarks regarding lapglitch

* Every event, SMS, loading screen, etc. has **an assigned static hex address**. When it comes to races, many share __the same address__. This means that lap glitching one race can glitch others in the same time without glitching them directly. This saves a lot of menuing time and this is why speedrunners don't glitch all circuits/knockouts.
* You can also **"break"** the lap glitch you've just done by starting a race, going back to free roam or to the safe house and triggering any event (starting another race, completing a speedtrap camera, ...).

## Boss skip

When you complete a boss, there is a continue button in the lower left corner, before the markers section. If you click it just about right in the right corner, you will skip the boss you were fighting against.

> Note : The markers that will be displayed after boss skipping will not be those of the boss you skipped, but those of the boss you just defeated.
