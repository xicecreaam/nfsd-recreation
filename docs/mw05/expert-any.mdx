# Expert Career Any% route

An ultra-optimized route that demands mastery, consistency, and flawless execution.

At this point, you can skip some cameras, depending on how much bounty you farm during the chase. The following table resumes how many cam(s) you can skip.

|   ฿   |  Cam skip ? |
|:-----:|:-----------:|
| 18k   | no cam skip |
| 21k   | 1 cam skip  |
| 28.5k | 2 cams skip |
| 34k   | 3 cams skip |

### If yes, cams should be skipped in this order : **Vic Cam 1** → **Cam 1** → **Vic Cam 2**

Once escaped, go back to *SH* and lapglitch **C6**.  
Go back to free roam and start *Race 1*. If you are in the situation where you cannot skip any cam, hit Vic *Cam 2* **(170 km/h | 105 mph)** after the race on your left.  
Start Vic *Race 1*. Quit to free roam, turn around and go for *Cam 1* **(185 km/h | 115 mph)**.  
Do *Race 5*, *Race 6* and then a *QE*.  
Challenge Izzy and complete both *Boss races*.  
**Boss skip !** Choose the *Performance marker*, *1 random marker* and confirm to move on to the next boss.
