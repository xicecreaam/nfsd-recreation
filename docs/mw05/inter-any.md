# Intermediate Career Any% guide

A route designed for those who have mastered the basics and want to optimize their runs.

## <font color="#d94c4c">Prerequisite before starting</font>

If you discover this route, you are surely a player who is now more comfortable with the game. If this is not the case, you must go through the "Beginners route".

* **From now on, every Quick Escape is started from *Bounty 1*. Every manual chase is started from *Bounty 2*.**  
* **Unless otherwise stated, every race will be started from free roam.**

### Abbreviations

In any case, we are going to make things a little more challenging and simplify some words / expressions to give a "more experienced" approach.

|    Word / Expression   |     Abbreviation      |
|:----------------------:|:---------------------:|
| BMW                    | **M3**                |
| Safe house             | **SH**                |
| Quick Escape           | **QE**                |
| Camera                 | **Cam**               |
| Aerodynamics           | **Aero**              |
| Taz manual chase       | **Taz cure**          |
| Roadblock              | **Block**             |
| Cost to state          | **CTS**               |
| Bounty                 | **฿**                 |
| Circuit x, y, ...      | **Cx**, **Cy**, ...   |
| Lap knockout x, y, ... | **KOx**, **KOy**, ... |

### Another way to trigger cops

Thanks to the **High World Details**, you will be able to trigger a cop speech earlier than usual on some races. This means you can encounter cops during them which results in a time save. See below an example of how to trigger a cop speech early.

> :bangbang: The races where an early cop speech can be triggered will be written in <font color="#19bf00">***green***</font> for the rest of this guide.

### Cooldown trick

In the game, you have something called `Cop spawn rate`. It means that after an exact amount of time, cops are spawning and it depends on which condition (:fire:) you are. This spawn rate is quickly maxed out after time but you can max it out way faster and easily. How doest it work ? **By going in and out of cooldown, you somehow force the cop spawn to its maximum.**

***

## Prologue

Start the run by lapglitching **C14**, **C1**, **C2** and **C3**. You can press LB/L1 to lapglitch **C14** faster, depending if you're using an XInput or a DSX controller. Then, RB/R1 or LB/L1 twice to lapglitch **C1**, **C2** and **C3**.

  <summary>Intermediate / Expert first lap glitch example</summary>
  <img src="/nfsd-recreation/img/mw-lapglitch-v2.gif" alt="Gif showing how to perform the lap glitch" />
</details>

Cutscene time...... Once you gain control of the M3, full NOS and reach the Mia call trigger.  
Complete Ronnie and Bull sprints + Rog circuit as usual. Usually, after this race you have a cutscene involving Razor and you but you can **skip this cutscene very easily**. When you cross the finish line, **restart the race** then open the menu, quit back to main menu and go into career again. This glitch will skip the cutscene and will send you directly to Razor sprint.  
Complete Razor sprint as usual. Then, buy the Golf (4) and go to **SH**.

## Sonny

Do *Race 1* from the *Safe house*. After finishing the race, turn around and go to the performance shop. Install any *spoiler* you want and *Race Engine*.  
Start <font color="#19bf00">*Race 2*</font> from free roam. Once at the stadium, at around 48% of the race, press start and tune *Aero* to `+5`. If you trigger the cops in the race, finish the race without losing them. Then, you need to escort the cops and head to the stadium by taking [this path](https://ibb.co/yBxV06fw).  
If you don't get cops during the race, start a manual chase.  
Do *Cam 1* **(130 km/h | 80 mph)**.  
Do *Race 3* then challenge Sonny. Complete both *Boss races*.  
<font color="red">**Don't boss skip !**</font> Just spam your Confirm button (A or X or with the mouse). Choose *2 random markers* and confirm to move on to the next boss.

    **Boss skip !** Choose the *Performance marker*, *1 random marker* and confirm to move on to the next boss.

* **Scenario 2 — You got Sonny's car <ins>only</ins>.**

    Go back to *SH*, sell Sonny's car and lapglitch **C4** and **C5**.  
    Quit to free roam, go to the performance shop to your right and upgrade *Race Transmission*, *Pro Suspension* and *Pro NOS*.  
    Do *Cam 1* **(150 km/h | 93 mph)**.  
    Tune *Handling* to `-1`, *Ride Height* to `+5` and *NOS* to `+2`.  
    Start <font color="#19bf00">*Race 3*</font>. If you trigger the cops in the race, finish the race without losing them. Then, continue forwards to the stadium and kill everybody chasing you with the stadium pursuit breaker. Escape on the **same hiding spot** as on Sonny.  
    Do *Cam 2* **(145 km/h | 90 mph)** after the chase.  
    If you don't get cops during *Race 3*, start a manual chase. You would also hit *Cam 2* **(145 km/h | 90 mph)** during the chase.  
    Do *Race 1*, *Race 4* and *Race 6* then challenge Taz. Complete both *Boss races*.  
    **Boss skip !** Choose the *Performance marker*, *1 random marker* and confirm to move on to the next boss.

* Tag 8 cops.
* The chase length is between 4:00 and 4:20.
* **The bounty requirement for this chase is <ins>10k</ins> minimum.** You should get at least 15k at the end of the chase anyways.

If you don't trigger the cops during the race, start a manual chase. Try to trigger a backup as soon as possible.  

Once escaped, go back to *SH* and lapglitch **C6**.  
Then, start *Race 2* from *SH*.

* Gather 5 cops and drive to [the gas station behind you in Gray Point](https://ibb.co/nNryYmKY).

If you don't trigger the cops during the race, start a manual chase from *Bounty 2*. Then **gather 5 cops as soon as possible and kill them at the closest pursuit breaker**.  
Do *Race 1*. Then hit Vic *Cam 2* **(170 km/h | 105 mph)** after the race on your left.  
Start Vic *Race 1* from the *Race menu*. Once it loads, quit to free roam, turn around and go for *Cam 1* (185 km/h | 115 mph).

## Baron

Upgrade *Pro Engine*, *Super Pro Suspension* and *Super Pro NOS*.  
Do *Race 7* and *Race 5*.  
Start a manual chase. Do the cooldown trick one time. The chase length has to be 5 minutes minimum.  

* The bounty requirement for this chase depends on the amount of roadblocks you will get.

| Blocks |  ฿   |
|:------:|:----:|
| 0 - 1  | 147k |
| 2 - 3  | 117k |
| ≥ 4    | 90k  |

> If you get at least 4 blocks during the chase, you will not need to hit *Cam 3* **(225 km/h |140 mph)** as you already completed 4 milestones. But if you get less than 4 blocks, you will need to hit it anyways.
> There are 2 ways to hit *Cam 3* :

  * a safe way : from *Race 2* ;
  * a hard way : from *Race 8*.

  If you feel confident, choose the hard way but it requires practice since the cam speed requirement is **225 km/h**.  
  **I suggest to stick to the safe way if you are trying this route for the first time.**

After the chase, go back to *SH* and lapglitch **KO6**.  
Go back to free roam and start *Race 1*.  
Do *Race 2*.  
Do *Race 8*.  
No matter where you hit *Cam 3*, challenge Baron. Complete both *Boss races*.  
**Boss skip !** Choose the *Performance marker*, *1 random marker* and confirm to move on to the next boss.

Do *Cam 2* **(238 km/h | 148 mph)**.  
Do *Race 3*. Hit Earl *Cam 2* **(220 km/h | 137 mph)** afterwards.  
Start <font color="#19bf00">*Race 4*</font>. If you trigger the cops in the race, finish the race without losing them. The chase length has to be 6 minutes minimum. You would also tag 18 cops and commit 5 infractions to complete 3 milestones.  

* The bounty requirement is an exact amount depending on whether you got 4 blocks on Baron, whether you get 6 blocks during this chase, whether you gather both 4 AND 6 blocks milestones or nothing at all.

| Milestone    |  6 mins  |
|:------------:|:--------:|
| none         | **368k** |
| 4 blocks     | **333k** |
| 6 blocks     | **322k** |

Start a manual chase.

* The chase length has to be between 7:00 and 8:00.
* Tag 22 cops and avoid 4 spikes to complete 3 milestones.
* Regarding the *10 roadblocks milestone*, it is not necessary to do but can be extra bounty for the next chapter.
* **The bounty requirement for this chase is <ins>not an exact amount</ins>. Try to get as much as bounty as you can in due time. The minimum is <ins>700k</ins>.**

Go back to *SH* and lapglitch **KO11**.  
Tune Handling to `0` or `+1` (depending on what you prefer) and start *Race 7* from free roam.  
***Usually, +1 makes the Golf easier to drive.***

## JV

Upgrade *Ultimate Transmission*, *Ultimate Suspension* and *Ultimate NOS*.  
Do *Cam 3* **(245 km/h | 152 mph)**.  
Start a manual chase.

* Earn 150k CTS and commit 6 infractions.
* The bounty requirement for this chase is not an exact amount. It highly depends on how much bounty you got after Ming chase knowing that you need to accumulate 2300k bounty to challenge him. With this **2300k base**, you will need **912k bounty** during JV chase, as fast as possible. However, this amount can be drastically reduced if the bounty grinding during Ming chase was good. To sum up, let's draw up a table :

| Bounty at the end <br /> of Ming chapter | Bounty requirement <br /> for JV chase |
|:----------------------------------------:|:--------------------------------------:|
| 2300k                                    | 912k                                   |
| 2400k                                    | 812k                                   |
| 2500k                                    | 712k                                   |
| 2800k                                    | 412k                                   |
