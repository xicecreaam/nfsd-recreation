* Don't make the chase last forever above 4 minutes. If you triggered your backup early, you can do a 4:00 flat chase.

Lapglitch **C6** and start *Race 2* from *SH*.

* Wait for 5 cops to spawn and kill them at [the gas station behind you](https://ibb.co/nNryYmKY) in 40 - 50 seconds. It is possible to do a sub 40 chase here if the spawn is good.
* You can skip some cameras, depending on how much bounty you farm during the first chase. The following table resumes how many cam(s) you can skip.

|   ฿   |  Cam skip ? |
|:-----:|:-----------:|

Start *Race 1*. If you are in the situation where you cannot skip any cam, hit Vic *Cam 2*. Then, start Vic *Race 1*. Quit to free roam, turn around and go for *Cam 1*.  
Do *Race 1*, *Race 5* and challenge Izzy.

## Baron

> |:-----------------------------:|:----------------------------:|:---------------------------:|:---------------------------------------:|
> |              Yes              |              No              |             Yes             |                   Yes                   |

> |               No              |              Yes             |              No             |                    No                   |

Do *Race 7* and *Race 5*.  
Start a manual chase. Do the cooldown trick one time.

* Don't waste too much time in this chase. A 5:30-ish one is ok but the faster you get the better it is.
* The bounty requirement for this chase depends on the amount of roadblocks you will get.

| Blocks |  ฿   |
|:------:|:----:|
| 0 - 1  | 147k |
| 2 - 3  | 117k |
| ≥ 4    | 90k  |

After the chase, lapglitch **KO6**.  
Do *Race 1*.  
Do *Race 2*.  
Do *Race 8*. If you got less than 4 blocks, go hit *Cam 3*. Otherwise skip it and challenge Baron.  
**Boss skip !** Choose the *Susp junkman marker* and *1 random marker*.

## Jewels

No upgrades here.  
Do *Cam 2*.  
Do *Race 3*. Hit Earl *Cam 2* afterwards.  
Start <font color="#19bf00">*Race 4*</font>.

* You can do a sub 6 chase if you have a good overshoot from Baron and if the bounty is really good on this chase.
* The bounty requirement is an exact amount depending on whether you got 4 blocks on Baron, whether you get 6 blocks during this chase, whether you gather both 4 AND 6 blocks milestones or nothing at all.

|       —      | 6 mins | sub 6 | sub 6 + QE |
|:------------:|:------:|:-----:|:----------:|
|     none     |  368k  |  404k |    358k    |
|   4 blocks   |  333k  |  369k |    323k    |
|   6 blocks   |  322k  |  358k |    312k    |
| 4 + 6 blocks |  287k  |  323k |    277k    |

* **If you don't get cops on *Race 4*, start *Race 5* from *SH*.**
* If you still don't get cops on this one, <font color="red">**RESET**</font>. You could risk it, but at this point, you would lose time by doing a manual chase.

|   If...   | What do to |
|:---------:|:----------:|
| ฿ ≥ 1156k |    Cam 3   |
| ฿ ≥ 1134k |     QE     |
| ฿ ≥ 1110k | Cam 3 + QE |

Lapglitch **KO8**.  
Do *Race 2*.  
If your chase was sub 6, do *Cam 3*, otherwise skip it.
Do *Race 1* and *Race 6*.  
If you are short on bounty, do a *QE*.
Then challenge Jewels. Complete both *Boss races*.  
**Boss skip !** Choose the *Trans junkman marker*, *1 random marker*

## Ming

Upgrade *Super Pro Eng* and *Ultimate Tires*.  
Do *Race 10*. You can do a better start here by **instant shift up to 2nd gear** as soon as the race starts. Doing this skips the wheelspin even better because the starting line is uphill.  
Do *Race 7*.  
Start <font color="#19bf00">*Race 3*</font>.

* You can do a sub 7 chase if you have a good overshoot from Jewels and if the bounty is really good on this chase.
* Trigger the backup ASAP if your heat is close to switch to :fire: 4. If not, babysit the cops until your heat bar is close to switch to :fire: 4.
* The bounty requirement is an exact amount depending on **how many blocks** you will get, considering it's a **sub 7 minutes chase**. The following tables show how much ฿ you would farm for two scenarios, depending if you can aim for **<ins>a perfect JV</ins>** or **<ins>a normal one</ins>**.
> :warning: If you don't get 8 blocks, you will need to do an extra cam, which is *Cam 3*. **It can be done by starting Kaze *Race 2* and quitting to free roam.**

* Normal JV *sub 7 minutes*

| Milestone  | ฿ to farm |
|:----------:|:---------:|
| < 8 blocks |   1140k   |
|  8 blocks  |   1116k   |
|  10 blocks |   1036k   |

#### These totals are calculated in a such way to farm **500k** bounty at JV.

* Perfect JV *sub 7 minutes*

| Milestone  | ฿ to farm |
|:----------:|:---------:|
| < 8 blocks |   1315k   |
|  8 blocks  |   1291k   |
|  10 blocks |   1211k   |

#### These totals are calculated in a such way to farm **the minimum** bounty at JV (**325k**).

* > In other words, if your bounty after the chase is 2887k if you kept the Jewels *QE* or 2993k if you did the Jewels *QE*, you will be able to do the perfect JV.
* **If you don't get cops on *Race 3*, start a manual chase.**

Lapglitch **KO8**.  
Do *Race 1*, *Race 4*, *Race 6* and *Race 8*.  
Lapglitch **C16**. `All Regions` = **C16** or `City` = **C2**.  
**Boss skip !** Choose *2 random markers*.

## JV

Choose *Cam 3* and go to the *Car Lot*. Buy the Elise (22) and choose to `Deliver` it.  
Once outside, do *Cam 3*.  
Start a manual chase from **the first *Milestone* event** instead of *Bounty 2*.  

* Challenging JV requires to do **6 infractions**. I recommend to do the `Speeding` infraction in the beginning of the chase, along with the `Hit & Run` one.
* The bounty requirement can be an exact amount if you aimed for the perfect JV at Ming.
* If you kept the Jewels QE until now, you can try to do a sub 3 minutes chase to get an **extra 116k bounty from Earl + Kaze**. If you did it, you will get only **70k extra bounty from Kaze**. If your chase is sub 2 minutes, you will get **90k extra bounty from Webster**.
* If your final bounty is between 3844k and 4050k, do a *QE*. ***฿ ∈ [3844k ; 4050k] → QE***

Sell all your cars you have including the Golf to keep the Elise your main car.  
Lapglitch **C18** and **KO14**.  
Upgrade *Super Pro Eng*, *Ultimate Trans*, *Susp*, *NOS*, *Tires*, *Pro Brakes*, *Super Pro Turbo* and all the junkman parts you have. Install any *spoiler*.

> :warning: You need at least 198k $ to fully upgrade the Elise.

Tune the car like this : `0` `-1` `+3` `+5` `+5` `+3` `+4`. Lower the Level of Details **one bar below the max** to hit less stuff on the road.  
Do *Race 2*, *Race 3*, *Race 5*, *Race 6*, *Race 7*, *Race 8*, *Race 9* then challenge JV.  
**Boss skip !** Choose the *Eng junkman marker* and skip the other one.

## Bull

Upgrade *Ultimate Eng*, *Turbo* and *Junkman Eng*.  
Do *Cam 1* and *Cam 3*.  
In this order, do *Race 12*, *Race 6*, *Race 11* and *Race 2*. **You can trigger each race from freeroam after the last one.**  
Start a manual chase from the first *Milestone* event instead of *Bounty 2*.

* It's Prayge time. **Get 8 spikes and trigger a backup ASAP.**
* **The bounty requirement here is <ins>2700k minimum</ins> but aim for <ins>3000k</ins> if possible. The more bounty you have at this point will be useful for Razor.**
* If your final bounty after Bull is 8068k, you will be able to do the perfect Razor (**850k**).

Lapglitch **C23**.  
Do *Race 1*. After the finishline, hit *Cam 2*.  
Do *Race 8*, *Race 9* and *Race 10* then challenge Bull.  
<font color="red">**Don't boss skip !**</font> Skip the markers.

## Razor

Do *Race 10*. Hit Ronnie *Cam 1*, *Cam 3* and *Cam 2*.  
Do *Race 11*. Hit *Cam 1*.  
Do *Race 1*. In the photofinish, restart the race, go back to *SH* and start *Race 3*.

* The bounty requirement depends on how much you did get during Bull chase. Let's draw up a table.

| Bounty at the end <br /> of Bull chapter | Bounty requirement <br /> for Razor chase |
|:----------------------------------------:|:-----------------------------------------:|
| 7550k                                    | 1368k                                     |
| 7800k                                    | 1118k                                     |
| 8000k                                    | 918k                                      |
| 8068k                                    | 850k                                      |

* If you didn't get cops, start a manual chase from *Bounty 2*.

Do *Race 4*, *Race 2*, *Race 5*, *Race 8* and *Race 9* then challenge Razor.

> :bangbang: If you are missing bounty, there are 3 extra cams you can do : 1 cam after *Race 5* and 2 cams after *Race 9*.

**Don't forgetti the out of boundetti on Razor *Boss race 3*.**

## Final pursuit
