# Advanced Information

Some informations you could find interesting to read if you want to progress in the hunt of the top.

## A new foe has appeared !

The Golf is a really good car. For racing and for chases. But it has its limits and some cars can outperform it like a charm. This is why we want to switch the Golf mid-run with **the Lotus Elise**. Why ? The Elise is lighter, more reactive and simply faster.

The car switch happens at the beginning of JV's segment *(cf. the expert guide)*. To upgrade correctly the Elise, we need to skip / keep some performance parts from the Golf for it, especially junkman parts.

## Better race starts

You can optimize any perfect start and get a better speed. To do so, you would **hold** the throttle at perfect launch level for around 0.3 - 0.4 second **after the race starts** and then go full throttle + use NOS. Cars tend to wheelspin after the `3-2-1 Go !` cooldown. Doing this strat skips this wheelspin and you will get the maximum speed the car can give.  
Let's compare the speed after emptying the NOS bar between holding the throttle and not holding it.

## Regarding tuning...

It's up to your preferences but you can actually be faster by tune you car differently.

### Taz

During Taz, after upgrading, you would tune the *Handling* on `-1`. You may be faster if you tune the *Handling* on `-3` but the car will understeer a lot more. `-3` is faster until Izzy race 2 if you have a fast menuing which saves ~1.5 second over `-1`.

### Ming

During Ming, after upgrading , you would tune back the Golf with *Handling* to `0`. You may stick to `-1` until the end of the run to be a bit faster. You will also gain time by not retuning.

## SMS skip

As a reminder, menuing is not instant in the game. And you are aware you receive SMSes during gameplay, either after races or after a chase. You can actually **skip** these SMSes if you are frame-perfect by opening the blacklist menu or the pause menu at the right moment.  
Skipping an SMS saves **approximatively 2 seconds**. This trick doesn't require practice whatsoever, just you need to know how to menu in this game by having the right momentum. It can require time to skip your first SMS and this is not mandatory to aim a really good time. But it's always a pleasure to save time.

> **:bangbang: If you want to have a go in the expert guide, you will notice that the race order on some bosses will change in order to encourage you to SMS skip.**

#### *Needs more investigation but as far as i know, these stats seem to be correct.

## Some new strats for Sonny !

### Camera 1

While doing the Sonny chase, after *Race 2*, you can hit *Cam 1* instead of escaping normally. When you kill your cops, turn around and go to *Cam 1*.

> **:bangbang: Note that a cop can spawn in front of you when you exit the stadium area. It will end up as a reset if so.**

### Early escape

While racing, you can trigger cops. But **your opponents can also trigger their cops** and somehow AI shares the same cop-related stuff with you, even after a race : `milestones - chase time - blocks`. This means you can use this to complete a `Roadblock milestone` faster (if you are lucky) or **escape earlier than usual** on Sonny chase.

After *Race 2*, if AI keeps its cops, do the chase normally and go to the stadium but this time, **you can kill your cops wave at 1:40 instead of 1:53**, turn around and go for *Cam 1*.

> **:bangbang: Note that a cop can <ins>also</ins> spawn in front of you when you exit the stadium area. It will end up as a reset if so.**
>
> :warning: The timer can be **bugged** if AI losts its cops then re-engages a chase. If it happens, go for a normal escape : <ins>kill your cops at 1:53</ins>.

## A DoN pursuit mechanic

> Instead of going around the hiding spot where you can perform the `Cooldown trick`, you can reset your car at a certain spot to clip below the slope. Once reset, you would steer right while in reverse and you will clip upwards back on the track.  
> This trick is meant to be performed during chases.
> 
> <span style={{ fontSize: '1.5rem', fontWeight: 'bold' }}>You can practice during chases but <ins>i don't recommend doing it in a run</ins>. If not well performed, you can get busted so easily since you reset your car.</span>

## Regarding SMS...

When you exit a performance shop or a car lot, during the loading screen, you can reset your car and teleport your car somewhere else to amore strategic location.  
For instance, after the prologue and buying the Golf, you are sent to free roam and you receive an SMS from Mia. If you click on your `Reset car` bind at the right moment, you can spawn on the road instead of on the sidewalk. This particular reset saves **approximatively 0.3 second**.
