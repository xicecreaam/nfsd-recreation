# Intermediate Career Any% guide

A route designed for those who have mastered the basics and want to optimize their runs.

## Prerequisite before starting

If you discover this route, you are surely a player who is now more comfortable with the game. If this is not the case, you must go through the "Beginners route".  
**From now on, every Quick Escape is started from *Bounty 1*. Every manual chase is started from *Bounty 2*.**

In any case, we are going to make things a little more challenging and simplify some words / expressions to give a "more experienced" approach.

|    Word / Expression   |     Abbreviation      |
|:----------------------:|:---------------------:|
| BMW                    | **M3**                |
| Safe house             | **SH**                |
| Quick Escape           | **QE**                |
| Camera                 | **Cam**               |
| Aerodynamics           | **Aero**              |
| Taz manual chase       | **Taz cure**          |
| Roadblock              | **Block**             |
| Cost to state          | **CTS**               |
| Bounty                 | **฿**                 |
| Circuit x, y, ...      | **Cx**, **Cy**, ...   |
| Lap knockout x, y, ... | **KOx**, **KOy**, ... |

Thanks to the **High World Details**, you will be able to trigger a cop speech earlier than usual on some races. This means you can encounter cops during them which results in a time save. See below an example of how to trigger a cop speech early.

## Prologue

Start the run by lapglitching **C14**, **C1**, **C2** and **C3**. You can press LB/L1 to lapglitch **C14** faster, depending if you're using an XInput or a DSX controller. Then, RB/R1 or LB/L1 twice to lapglitch **C1**, **C2** and **C3**.

</details>

Cutscene time...... Once you gain control of the M3, full NOS and reach the Mia call trigger.  
Complete Ronnie and Bull sprints + Rog circuit as usual. Usually, after this race you have a cutscene involving Razor and you but you can **skip this cutscene very easily**. When you cross the finish line, **restart the race** then open the menu, quit back to main menu and go into career again. This glitch will skip the cutscene and will send you directly to Razor sprint.  
Complete Razor sprint as usual. Then, buy the Golf (4) and go to **SH**.

## Sonny

Do *Race 1* from the *Safe house*. After finishing the race, turn around and go to the performance shop. Install any *spoiler* you want and *Race Engine*.  
Start *Race 2* from free roam. Once at the stadium, at around 51% of the race, press start and tune *Aero* to `+5`.  
If you don't get cops during the race, do a manual chase.  
Do *Cam 1* **(130 km/h | 80 mph)**.  
Do *Race 3* then challenge Sonny. Complete both *Boss races*.  
<font color="red">**Don't boss skip !**</font> Just spam your Confirm button (A or X or with the mouse). Choose *2 random markers* and confirm to move on to the next boss.

## Taz

Before continuing, it is important to note which marker you got at Sonny. **Two scenarios** are possible here :

    Upgrade *Race Transmission*, *Pro Suspension* and *Pro NOS*.  
    Do *Cam 1* **(150 km/h | 93 mph)**.  
    Start *Race 4*. During this race, after the 2 small S corners, tune *Handling* to `-1`, *Ride Height* to `+5` and *NOS* to `+2`.  
    Start *Race 3*. If you trigger the cops in the race, finish the race without losing them. Then, continue forwards to the stadium and kill everybody chasing you with the stadium pursuit breaker. Escape on the **same hiding spot** as on Sonny.  
    Do *Cam 2* **(145 km/h | 90 mph)** after the chase.  
    If you don't get cops during *Race 3*, do a manual chase. You would also hit *Cam 2* **(145 km/h | 90 mph)** during the chase.
    Go back to *SH* and lapglitch **C4** and **C5**.  
    Do *Race 1* and *Race 6* then challenge Taz. Complete both *Boss races*.  
    **Boss skip !** Choose the *Performance marker*, *1 random marker* and confirm to move on to the next boss.

* **Scenario 2 — You got Sonny's car <ins>only</ins>.**

    Go back to *SH*, sell Sonny's car and lapglitch **C4** and **C5**.  
    Quit to free roam, go to the performance shop to your right and upgrade *Race Transmission*, *Pro Suspension* and *Pro NOS*.  
    Do *Cam 1* **(150 km/h | 93 mph)**.  
    Start *Race 4*. During this race, after the 2 small S corners, tune *Handling* to `-1`, *Ride Height* to `+5` and *NOS* to `+2`.

## Izzy

Upgrade *Pro Tires* and *Junkman Suspension*.  
Do *Cam 2* **(195 km/h | 121 mph)**.
Start *Race 7*. If you trigger the cops in the race, finish the race without losing them. The chase length has to be 4 minutes minimum. You would also tag 8 cops during this chase to complete 2 milestones.  
If you don't trigger the cops during the race, do a manual chase. To spawn the cops faster, do the cooldown trick **3 times**. Try to trigger a backup as soon as possible.  
At this point, you can skip some cameras, depending on how much bounty you farm during the chase. The following table resumes how many cam(s) you can skip.

|   ฿   |  Cam skip ? |
|:-----:|:-----------:|
| 18k   | no cam skip |
| 21k   | 1 cam skip  |
| 28.5k | 2 cams skip |
| 34k   | 3 cams skip |

### If yes, cams should be skipped in this order : **Vic Cam 1** → **Cam 1** → **Vic Cam 2**

Once escaped, go back to *SH* and lapglitch **C6**.  
Go back to free roam and start *Race 1*. If you are in the situation where you cannot skip any cam, hit Vic *Cam 2* **(170 km/h | 105 mph)** after the race on your left.  
Start Vic *Race 1*. Quit to free roam, turn around and go for *Cam 1* **(185 km/h | 115 mph)**.  
Do *Race 5*, *Race 6* and then a *QE*.  
Challenge Izzy and complete both *Boss races*.  
**Boss skip !** Choose the *Performance marker*, *1 random marker* and confirm to move on to the next boss.

## Baron

Upgrade *Pro Engine*, *Super Pro Suspension* and *Super Pro NOS*.  
Do *Race 7* and *Race 5*.  
Start a manual chase. Do the cooldown trick one time. The chase length has to be 5 minutes minimum.
