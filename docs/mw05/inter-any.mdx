# Intermediate Career Any% guide

A route designed for those who have mastered the basics and want to optimize their runs.

## Prerequisite before starting

If you discover this route, you are surely a player who is now more comfortable with the game. If this is not the case, you must go through the "Beginners route".  
In any case, we are going to make things a little more challenging and simplify some words / expressions to give a "more experienced" approach.

|    Word / Expression   |     Abbreviation      |

| Safe house             | **SH**                |
| Quick Escape           | **QE**                |
| Camera                 | **Cam**               |
| Aerodynamics           | **Aero**              |
| Taz manual chase       | **Taz cure**          |
| Roadblock              | **Block**             |
| Cost to state          | **CTS**               |
| Bounty                 | **฿**                 |
| Circuit x, y, ...      | **Cx**, **Cy**, ...   |
| Lap knockout x, y, ... | **KOx**, **KOy**, ... |

<span style={{ fontSize: '1.5rem', fontWeight: 'bold' }}>Few bosses now require **a lot of strategies**. Throughout each boss section, there will be **informations about these strategies** linking to <ins>different videos</ins>. Those can be found at the end of each boss section.</span>

## Prologue

Start the run by lapglitching **C14**, **C1**, **C2** and **C3**. You can press LB/L1 to lapglitch **C14** faster, depending if you're using an XInput or a DSX controller. Then, RB/R1 or LB/L1 twice to lapglitch **C1**, **C2** and **C3**.

</details>

Cutscene time...... Once you gain control of the M3, full NOS and reach the Mia call trigger.  
Complete Ronnie and Bull sprints + Rog circuit as usual. Usually, after this race you have a cutscene involving Razor and you but you can **skip this cutscene very easily**. When you cross the finish line, **restart the race** then open the menu, quit back to main menu and go into career again. This glitch will skip the cutscene and will send you directly to Razor sprint.  
Complete Razor sprint as usual. Then, buy the Golf (4) and go to **SH**.

## Sonny

Do *Race 1* from the *Safe house*. After finishing the race, turn around and go to the performance shop. Install any *spoiler* you want and *Race Engine*.  
Start *Race 2* from free roam. Thanks to the **High World Details**, you will be able to trigger a cop speech earlier than usual on some races. This means you can encounter cops during them which results in a time save. See below an example of how to trigger a cop speech early. Once at the stadium, at around 51% of the race, press start and tune *Aero* to `+5`.

If you don't get cops during the race, do a manual chase from *Bounty 2*.  
Do *Cam 1* manually **(130 km/h | 80 mph)**.  
Do *Race 3* then challenge Sonny. Complete both *Boss races*.  
<font color="red">**Don't boss skip !**</font> Just spam your Confirm button (A or X or with the mouse). Choose *2 random markers* and confirm to move on to the next boss.

## Taz

Before continuing, it is important to note which marker you got at Sonny. **Two scenarios** are possible here :

* **Scenario 1 — You got the cash marker.**

    Upgrade *Race Transmission*, *Pro Suspension* and *Pro NOS*.  
    Do *Cam 1* **(150 km/h | 93 mph)**.  
    Start *Race 4*. During this race, after the 2 small S corners, tune *Handling* to `-1`, *Ride Height* to `+5` and *NOS* to `+2`.  
    Start *Race 3*. If you trigger the cops in the race, finish the race without losing them. Then, continue forwards to the stadium and kill everybody chasing you with the stadium pursuit breaker. Escape on the **same hiding spot** as on Sonny.  
    Do *Cam 2* **(145 km/h | 90 mph)** after the chase.  
    If you don't get cops during *Race 3*, do a manual chase from *Bounty 2* and do the following chase. You would also hit *Cam 2* **(145 km/h | 90 mph)** during this chase.

    Go back to *SH* and lapglitch **C4** and **C5**.  
    Do *Race 1* and *Race 6* then challenge Taz. Complete both *Boss races*.  
    **Boss skip !** Choose the *Performance marker*, *1 random marker* and confirm to move on to the next boss.

* **Scenario 2 — You got Sonny's car <ins>only</ins>.**

    Go back to *SH*, sell Sonny's car and lapglitch **C4** and **C5**.  
    Quit to free roam, go to the performance shop to your right and upgrade *Race Transmission*, *Pro Suspension* and *Pro NOS*.  
    Do *Cam 1* **(150 km/h | 93 mph)**.  
    Start *Race 4*. During this race, after the 2 small S corners, tune *Handling* to `-1`, *Ride Height* to `+5` and *NOS* to `+2`.  
    Start *Race 3*. If you trigger the cops in the race, finish the race without losing them. Then, continue forwards to the stadium and kill everybody chasing you with the stadium pursuit breaker. Escape on the **same hiding spot** as on Sonny.
